# Before You Begin

Hopefully you landed here before diving into the multitude of Laravel 9 tutorials. 

Why? Because I've done that for you. I have gone through many Laravel tutorials(*good **and** bad*) and collected useful and *correct* directions and information.

The tutorial steps you will find here have been *tested* and are *working*.

# No Docker Required

First, you really don't have to have Docker installed to begin using Laravel. I don't have anything against Docker. In fact I like it(for certain purposes). But it's definitely **not required**.
