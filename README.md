# Before You Begin

Hopefully you landed here before diving into the multitude of Laravel 9 tutorials. 

Why? Because I've done that for you. I have gone through many Laravel tutorials(*good **and** bad*) and collected useful and *correct* directions and information.

The tutorials and related source code you will find here have been *tested* and are *working*.

# No Docker Required

First, you really don't need to have Docker installed to begin using Laravel. It only depends on how you're already set up or what your development preferences are. And perhaps what you're targeting for deployment.

For example I already have MySQL and XAMPP installed on my development PCs and my deployment targets are LAMP stack web servers.

I don't have anything against Docker. In fact I like it, for certain purposes. But it's definitely **not required**.
